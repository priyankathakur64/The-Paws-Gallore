			<h1>Red Rumped Parakeets: Everything You Need To Know About Red
				Rump Parrots</h1>

			<img src="img\red_rump_parakeet.webp" alt="Three rabbits siting togehter" title="Apples" width="470px" height="350px">

		<p class="Introduction">There's definitely no doubt that you're
			reading this article because the beautiful plumage and sounds of the
			red rump parakeet have captured your heart. I mean... Who wouldn't
			want to adopt one, right? Well before you do, it's crucial to study
			and understand them first to know whether you really want to take
			responsibility for these birds or not. Species Overview Red Rump
			Parakeets (Psephotus haematonotus) are birds found in south-eastern
			Australia. They are also known as the Red-rumped Parakeet, Red-Backed
			Parrot, Red Rump Parrot, and Grass Parrot.</p>

		<h1>Characteristics</h1>
		<h2>Size And Appearance</h2>
		<p>They are medium-sized parrots that are only 27-28 centimeters
			(10.5-11 inches) long with half of it being its tail, and a slim body
			that weighs 1.9-3 ounces (55-85 grams) The male red rump parakeet is
			primarily bright emerald green, they have yellow underparts, blue
			wings, and upper back highlights and a red rump. On the other hand,
			females are less vibrant with their dull green back and wings, olive
			underparts, and dark blue wingtips. Both genders have flesh-colored
			legs and a black beak.</p>

		<h1>Behavior And Ability</h1> <br><h2>Sonation and Vocalization</h2> 
		<p>Red Rumped
			Parakeets have a balanced noise level, they're not too noisy. Yet
			they are not too quiet either as most of the noise they make is soft
			call-like songs that consist of satisfying chirps and tweets.</p> 
			<h2>Talking</h2>
			<p>These birds make beautiful vocalizations. However, they are not
			inclined to mimic sounds or voices, they are not skilled talkers
			either. Yet, with a lot of perseverance and patience, it is possible
			to teach them to talk. It is ideal that you teach them this instead
			of bringing them to a professional as birds tend to learn efficiently
			when taught by someone they have a strong bond with.</p>
			<h2> Life Expectancy</h2>
			<p>They are expected to live for 32 years with proper care and enough
			exercise. Although they commonly only live for 15 years in captivity.<p>

			<h1>Raising A Red Rump Parakeet</h1><h2> Personality</h2>
			<p> These birds have such
			pleasant and wonderful personalities, they are tremendously energetic
			and would love to roam around and explore their surroundings. They
			also love to socialize and will make sure that they spread affection
			towards those who spend time with them.</p>
			<h2> Accompaniment</h2>
			<p> Even though
			they are very social birds, they can still be aggressive and
			territorial towards their own kind, so it's best to keep them alone
			or with a pair only. However, they are not prone to being aggressive
			towards us humans. Their tiny beaks won't do much harm either, so it
			won't be a problem to let them play with children as long as they are
			supervised. They require a lot of toys and attention for mental
			stimulation as they get bored easily. It's best to spend time with
			them by hand feeding them or stroking them in order to strengthen
			your bond.</p>

		<p class="Introduction">Hamsters are popular small pets. If you
			are thinking about getting a pet hamster for you or a child, you must
			know how to choose one, what supplies you need, and how to feed and
			care for your new pet. Hamsters are typically low-maintenance pets
			but proper care is essential to keeping them happy and healthy.
			Here's what you need to know about hamsters as pets.</p>

		<h2>Choosing a Pet Hamster</h2>
		<p>Hamsters are popular pets for children and adults alike. They
			are small rodents that typically live about two years and are usually
			best housed alone. Hamsters come in a variety of colors and breeds,
			and different breeds are known for distinctive traits. There are 24
			hamster species, but some common ones include:
		<ul>
			<li>Chinese Hamsters: These small hamsters are not as common as
				other kinds of hamsters. Many people often mistake them for dwarf
				hamsters but they are not true dwarfs. They only grow to be 4 inches
				long.</li>
			<li>Dwarf Hamsters: There are several varieties of dwarf
				hamsters, such as Roborovskis and Russians, and they're similar to
				Chinese hamsters, but much more commonly found in pet stores.</li>
			<li>Syrian Hamsters: Syrian hamsters come in several color
				variations and go by different names, such as goldens, panda, and
				teddy bears. They are much larger than dwarf and Chinese hamsters
				and are the most commonly seen type of hamster.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<h2>Hamster Cages and Supplies</h2>
		<img alt="" src="img\cagehamster1.jpg">
		<p>You may also have to consider that smaller hamster breeds have
			different cage needs than the larger Syrian varieties, since cage
			wire spacing can determine whether or not a hamster can escape.
			Choose a cage that has good ventilation, is easy to clean, has enough
			space to run and explore, and won't allow your hamster to escape.

			Inside the hamster cage, you'll need to provide soft and absorbent
			bedding, a water bottle, an exercise wheel, chew toys, a house, and a
			food dish. Keep in mind that hamsters like and need to chew on items.
			Wood, cardboard, plastic, and other chewable items may not last long
			inside the enclosure.</p>

		<h2>Hand-taming Hamsters</h2>
		<img alt="" src="img\handtaming hamster.webp">
		<p>Hamsters can be tamed to be very sweet little pets but for
			anyone who has ever been bitten, they know hamster bites definitely
			aren't fun. Young hamsters are typically easier to hand-tame, but you
			can start teaching your hamster not to bite by making sure you don't
			startle it. Try not to wake it up, and instead entice it to climb
			onto your hand on its own using a tasty treat. This will allow you to
			gain your hamster's trust over time, and allow you to pet and hold
			your hamster while avoiding being bitten. Hamsters are not aggressive
			pets but if they are scared or startled they may bite.</p>

		<h2>Toys for Hamsters</h2>
		<img alt="" src="img\hamsters-toys.webp">

		<p>Hamsters need to be active and have enrichment so they don't
			become bored and overweight. They also need chew toys to keep their
			teeth neat and trim. There are a variety of hamster toys that are
			designed to be chewed so your hamster's teeth can be properly cared
			for, and an exercise wheel will allow a hamster to run as much as
			they want. Special balls can also be purchased to allow a hamster to
			run around safely outside its cage; cute houses and other climbable
			options are available to provide your hamster with ample exercise.</p>

		<h2>Breeding Hamsters</h2>
		<img alt="" src="img\breeding hamster.webp">

		<p>Hamster breeding is not something the casual hamster owner
			should do. It is best left to hamster breeders who are breeding for
			specific qualities and temperaments. However, accidents do happen.
			Many unsuspecting new hamster owners find themselves with a pregnant
			hamster after purchasing it from a pet store. Extra food and a quiet
			nesting area inside the cage need to be provided to a pregnant
			hamster. Be aware that, in some cases, hamsters will kill or eat
			their babies.</p>

		<h2>Feeding Hamsters</h2>

		<p>If you offer a pelleted diet instead of a seed mixture and
			supplement it with a variety of other safe foods, you will be
			providing your hamster with everything needed to thrive. Greens are a
			good option to offer daily; parsley, kale, romaine, peas, and squash
			are all good options. Your hamster's diet should be made of 75
			percent fortified pellets, 20 percent veggies, greens, and fruits,
			and 5 percent treats. It's also a good idea to provide hay in your
			hamster's environment to help with nesting and foraging. Most
			hamsters will also eat the immature seeds in the hay.</p>

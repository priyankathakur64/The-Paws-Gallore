			<h1>10 Pet Care Tips</h1>

		<h2>1. Regular Exams are Vital</h2>
		<p>Just like you, your pet can get heart problems, develop
			arthritis, or have a toothache. The best way to prevent such problems
			or catch them early is to see your veterinarian every year. Regular
			exams are the single most important way to keep pets healthy. Annual
			vet visits should touch on nutrition and weight control, as well as
			cover recommended vaccinations, parasite control, dental exam, and
			health screenings.</p>
			<img alt="" src="img\care1.jpg">

		<hr>
		<h2>2. Spay and Neuter Your Pets</h2>
		
		<p>Eight million to 10 million pets end up in U.S. shelters every
			year. Some are lost, some have been abandoned, and some are homeless.

			Here’s an easy way to avoid adding to that number — spay and neuter
			your cats and dogs. It’s a procedure that can be performed as early
			as six to eight weeks of age. Spaying and neutering doesn’t just cut
			down on the number of unwanted pets; it has other substantial
			benefits for your pet. Studies show it also lowers the risk of
			certain cancers and reduces a pet’s risk of getting lost by
			decreasing the tendency to roam.</p>
			<img alt="" src="img\care2.jpg">

		<h2>3. Prevent Parasites</h2>
		
		<p>Fleas are the most common external parasite that can plague
			pets, and they can lead to irritated skin, hair loss, hot spots, and
			infection. Fleas can also introduce other parasites into your cat or
			dog. All it takes is for your pet to swallow one flea, and it can to
			end up with tapeworms, the most common internal parasite affecting
			dogs and cats. Year-round prevention is key. Regular flea and
			intestinal parasite control, as well as heartworm prevention in
			endemic areas is important. Because some parasite medications made
			for dogs can be fatal to cats, talk to your vet about keeping your
			precious pets worm-free, flea-free — and safe.</p>
			<img alt="" src="img\care3.jpg">

		<h2>4. Maintain a Healthy Weight</h2>


		<p>Many dogs and cats are overweight or obese. And just like
			people, obesity in pets comes with health risks that include
			diabetes, arthritis, and cancer. Overfeeding is the leading cause of
			obesity, says Douglas, who adds that keeping our pets trim can add
			years to their lives. Because pets need far fewer calories than most
			of us think — as little as 185-370 a day for a small, inactive dog;
			just 240-350 calories daily for a 10-pound cat — talk to your vet,
			who can make feeding suggestions based on your pet’s age, weight, and
			lifestyle.</p>

		<h2>5. Get Regular Vaccinations</h2>


		<p>For optimal health, pets need regular vaccinations against
			diseases such as rabies, distemper, feline leukemia, and canine
			hepatitis. How often your dog or cat needs to be immunized depends on
			their age, lifestyle, health, and risks so talk to your vet about the
			vaccinations that make sense for your pet.</p>

		<h2>6. Provide an Enriched Environment</h2>

		<p>An enriched environment is another key to the long-term health
			and welfare of your canine and feline friends. Pets need mental
			stimulation which may mean daily walks for your pooch, and scratching
			posts, window perches, and toys for your cat. It means play time with
			you, which not only keeps your pet’s muscles toned and boredom at
			bay, it also strengthens your bond with your four-footed companions.</p>


		<h2>7. Microchip and Tattoo Your Pet</h2>
		<img alt="" src="img\care5.jpg">		

		<p>Lack of identification means as few as 14% of pets ever find
			their way home after getting lost. Fortunately, microchipping and/or
			tattooing can allow for the pet to be reunited with its. About the
			size of a rice grain, a microchip is inserted under the skin in less
			than a second. It needs no battery and can be scanned by a vet or an
			animal control officer in seconds.</p>


		<h2>8. Pets Need Dental Care, Too</h2>
		<img alt="" src="img\care8.gif">

		<p>Just like you, your pet can suffer from gum disease, tooth
			loss, and tooth pain. And just like you, regular brushing and oral
			cleanings help keep your pet’s teeth strong and healthy. Dental
			disease is one of the most common preventable illnesses in pets yet
			many people never even look in their pet’s mouths. It’s estimated 80%
			of dogs and 70% cats show signs of dental disease by age three,
			leading to abscesses, loose teeth, and chronic pain. In addition to
			regular dental cleanings by your vet, periodontal disease can be
			avoided by proper dental care by owners. Owner care includes
			brushing, oral rinses, and dental treats.</p>


		<h2>9. Never Give Pets People Medication</h2>

		<p>Medicines made for humans can kill your pet. As a matter of
			fact, in 2010 the ASPCA listed human drugs in the top 10 pet toxins.

			NSAIDs like ibuprofen and naproxen are the most common pet poisoning
			culprits, but antidepressants, decongestants, muscle relaxants, and
			acetaminophen are just a few of the human drugs that pose health
			risks to pets. Human drugs can cause kidney damage, seizures, and
			cardiac arrest in a dog or cat. If you suspect your pet has consumed
			your medication — or anything toxic — call your veterinarian.</p>

		<h2>10. Proper Restraint in a Vehicle</h2>
<img alt="" src="img\care10.jpg">
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Never allow pets to travel in the front seat, where they’re
				at risk of severe injury or death if the airbag deploys.</li>
			<li>Don't let dogs ride with their head out the window or
				untethered in the back of a truck bed. Both practices put them at
				risk of being thrown from the vehicle in the event of an accident.</li>
			<li>To keep pets safe, confine cats to carriers, then secure the
				carrier with a seatbelt. For dogs, there’s the option of a special
				harness attached to a seat belt, or a well-secured kennel.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

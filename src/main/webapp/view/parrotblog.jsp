			<h1>TEACHING A PARROT TO TALK</h1>

			<img src="img\parrattalk.webp" alt="Three rabbits siting togehter"
				title="Apples" width="470px" height="350px">
		</center>
		<p class="Introduction">In spite of their popular image as masters
			of wit, repartee and pieces-of-eight, not all parrots learn to talk.
			They are always vocal, but you need to put in time and effort to
			transform some of that chatter into recognisable human ‘speech’.
			Catching them young is the trick, but even then they need to be
			bombarded with human sounds on a daily basis. Even that isn’t a
			guarantee – a noisy household will sometimes inspire a parrot to make
			his own version of busy background noise, which isn’t always pleasing
			on the ear! If your household noise is less about screaming kids and
			more about single voices talking calmly, you’re in with a very good
			chance of a talking bird.</p>

		<h2>FIRST LESSONS FOR TALKING PARROTS</h2>
		<p>In the early stages of teaching you’ll be repeating chosen
			phrases such as “Nero is a good boy!” Words spoken with feeling and
			dramatic expression make the biggest impression. Imagine you’re
			speaking encouragingly to a baby - that’s the sort of tone that gets
			results. Repeating the phrases ‘parrot fashion’ will deliver results
			eventually.</p>

		<hr>
		<h2>TIPS FOR TEACHING PARROTS TO TALK</h2>

		<p><ul>You should be able to loosen the bird’s tongue if you try some
			of the following: <li>A good starting point is to talk as you put food or
			water into a cage. Start with a ‘Hello’-type greeting as you approach
			the cage or enclosure. Always say ‘goodbye’ (or similar) when you
			walk away from the bird or leave the room.</li><li> Repeat these stock phrases
			whenever you’re near the parrot. Parrots are very interested in
			sounds, and will listen and watch you as you speak.</li><li> Try to catch the
			parrot when he’s at his most receptive – first thing in the morning,
			or just before feeding time, for example – rather than when he’s
			distracted (i.e. tired, angry, busy with other birds, or in any way
			flustered).</li><li> Choose some simple words or phrases, and repeat them for
			at least two minutes, and no longer than five. Do this as many times
			as possible during the day.</li><li> Try to fit in several short teaching
			sessions over the course of each day.</li><li> If you say things like “I love
			food!” as you fill the trays, your parrot will link the sound to the
			action. If you’re lucky, he will start to say “I love food!” when you
			begin the bowl-replenishing process. Make the chosen sounds every
			time you carry out a certain action. It will take time – months –
			but, at the very least, it will build your bond with the parrot.</li>
			<li>Naming vegetables and fruit is a good trick too. Hold out a piece of
			carrot, banana, or whatever, and say the word for it clearly. Over
			time, if he’s conducive to such training, the parrot will learn the
			word for each item of food. When you say ‘carrot’, he will know what
			you mean; and if he says the word, try to offer the food as a reward
			(without overdoing any single foodstuff – a clever parrot will soon
			learn that saying the magic word produces his favourite treat!)</li><li> Words
			said with feeling tend to stick. Unfortunately, this is why swear
			words and things like “Wow!” “Stop it!” and “Ouch!” tend to creep
			into a parrot’s vocabulary. This should not be taken as a cue to
			shout at your bird, but it is worth bearing in mind (as a note of
			caution as much as anything!)</li><li> Encourage the phrases you want by
			rewarding with treats and enthusiasm; and discourage undesirables by
			not responding, or by firing back a desirable word each time.</li></ul></p>

		<h2>TIPS FOR RELUCTANT TALKERS</h2>

		<p>There are alternatives to the ‘association’ type of learning.
			Choose a quiet moment with your bird – settling him on a standalone
			perch is ideal – and repeat your chosen phrase. Reward the parrot
			when he makes a noise in response. Parrots seem to pay intention to
			higher-pitched words and phrases. Female voices are therefore ideal
			vehicles for teaching speech to a bird. If your parrot still
			struggles to make sense of the noise, pick a single syllable word
			(such as “hi”), or the first syllable of a longer word. For example,
			if your parrot is called Nero, start with “Neer”, and only add the
			“o” when he’s mastered the first bit. If the parrot is hand-trained,
			hold him to your face as you speak, and let him see and hear the
			words close up.</p>
